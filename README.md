What is GitHub? Why GitHub icon is a cat? To be or not to be?

- Answer:
"The founders purchased a stock illustration of a half-cat, half-octopus character standing in a puddle and placed it on the pages that appear when a server has a problem or a user requests a link that doesn't. The character they purchased, then known as the “Octopuss”, was created by Simon Oxley."
